## About Me

I live in the United States (Cincinnati, OH) and Iâ€™m a Software Engineer happily writing Elixir for my day job and my hobby projects.

I mostly write about technologies Iâ€™m exploring and lessons Iâ€™ve learned in hopes that I can help reduce barriers for anyone else struggling with similar problems or exploring similar ideas.

You can find me in the FediVerse or at my https site.
