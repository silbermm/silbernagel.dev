## Who Am I?

I live in the United States (Cincinnati, OH) and I'm a Software Engineer happily writing [#Elixir](https://silbernagel.dev/tags/Elixir) for my day job and my hobby projects.

I use this [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) site to write about technologies I'm exploring and lessons I've learned in hopes that I can help reduce barriers for anyone else struggling with similar problems or exploring similar ideas.

You can find me in the FediVerse at [@ahappydeath@freeradical.zone](https://freeradical.zone/@ahappydeath).

The content here is also available via [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) at [gemini://silbernagel.dev/](gemini://silbernagel.dev/).

My GPG public key is available [on this site](/gpg) and via [WKD](https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKD#What_is_a_Web_Key_Directory.3F)

## How this site is built

This site is built with Elixir and Phoenix and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/silbermm/silbernagel.dev).

I use the [NimblePublisher](https://hexdocs.pm/nimble_publisher/NimblePublisher.html) library to generate static content like my [Posts](/posts) which are also syndicated in the fediverse at [@silbernagel.dev@silbernagel.dev](https://fed.brid.gy/user/silbernagel.dev) and also available via [RSS](/posts/rss.xml).

<!-- Comments and likes are accepted via [WebMentions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/#introduction) and are stored in a [distributed SQLite](/posts/distributed-sqlite-with-elixir) database which is hosted on [Fly.io](https://fly.io) alongside this site. -->
