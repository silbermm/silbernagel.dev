I recently worked on a project that used [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) as the infrastructure. We decided to try out their new [App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/), but couldn't find any good examples for Elixir/Phoenix. Here is what we did to get our app deployed and working.

## Deploying
